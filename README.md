## Monkey Lang in Rust

note: project currently on hold for a little bit, while I wrap some other projects up.

Currently rewriting [monkey-lang](https://github.com/bradford-hamilton/monkey-lang) in Rust, which was originally designed in [_Writing An Interpreter In Go_](https://interpreterbook.com/) and [_Writing a Compiler in Go_](https://compilerbook.com).
